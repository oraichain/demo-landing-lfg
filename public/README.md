# Public Assets

Place your video files and thumbnails here:

- `video1.mp4` - Video file for Video 1 page
- `video2.mp4` - Video file for Video 2 page
- `thumbs/video1-poster.jpg` - Poster/thumbnail image for Video 1
- `thumbs/video2-poster.jpg` - Poster/thumbnail image for Video 2

Files in the `public/` directory are served at the root path, so `/video1.mp4` will reference `public/video1.mp4`.
